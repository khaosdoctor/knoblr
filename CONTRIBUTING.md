# :star: Contributing :star:

So, you want to contribute to this humble project? That's awesome! But... Before doing that, please read the instructions bellow, they will guide you on how to write and send your help. So both of us will not be wasting time on wrong issues :D

## Discuss & Describe :thumbsup:

- If you found something that might help to develop this project, please open a pull-request and discuss the idea first, I'll always anwer all the request as fast as possible
- If you found a bug or something, please be very specific when describing it. This means that all the information about your current environment (e.g OS, Node Version, Bower Version etc.), screenshots and other things are very useful when solving this issue
- If you already know what is happening and knows how to fix it, please follow these steps:
  - Fork the repo
  - Fix the issue
  - Commit with a **very descriptive** commit message (this means writing literally all your thoughts on that, don't worry I won't judge you)
  - Open a Pull Request with the title `Fix for <the bug>`

> It is recomended to wait for a reply before continuing, however if the issue is easy to solve (like a syntax error) then you are free to fly, Willy

## Features and Fixes

- Follow these guidelines to work with the project in your environment.
- **Always** fork the project
- Create a branch `your-feature`
- Don't commit an entire hunk of 565 lines of code at once, because I will not read it. Break your commit into small chunks so it is easily readable.
- Add yourself to the `contributors` section of the `package.json` file

```json
{
  "contributors": [
     "Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)"
  ]
}
```

## Avoiding Repetition

- Before creating a pull request and/or an issue, please verify if this issue hasn't been fixed yet

## Just do it!

If you followed all this simple steps, congrats! You are now part of the team! All help is appreciated :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
